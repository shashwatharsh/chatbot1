## Chatbot Application

This is a simple chatbot application built using Python. The chatbot generates random greetings, responds to user input with pre-defined responses or common questions, and continues the conversation until the user chooses to exit.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shashwatharsh/chatbot1.git




The chatbot will display a random greeting and prompt you to enter your input. You can type in your message, and the chatbot will respond accordingly. If you wish to exit the chat, simply type "exit".
